## Description

ProteinSketch is a VR-assisted protein design workflow for translating a designer's spatial intent into protein with RFdiffusion. Designers can sketch backbone topologies and volumetric envelopes in 3D, then use those sketches to guide *de novo* monomer design, binder design, and partial-diffusion refinement.

This repository provides the RFdiffusion-side patch for ProteinSketch. It adds support for ProteinSketch JSON input, embedded OpenVDB SDF volumes, volume-guided potentials, inferred contig lengths from sketched envelopes, and sketch-derived partial diffusion.

ProteinSketch JSON input can be made from https://proteinsketch.app or https://proteinsketch.com with VR headset (non-VR version is coming soon).

## Documentation

This patch builds on the official [RFdiffusion](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion) codebase.

For general RFdiffusion usage, model weights, and installation details, see the official RFdiffusion repository and documentation. This README only documents the ProteinSketch-specific patch and JSON/OpenVDB input workflow.

# Getting started / installation

ProteinSketch is distributed as a patch to RFdiffusion. First install RFdiffusion, model weights, and dependencies from the official repository:

```text
https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion
```

## Base RFdiffusion version

This patch is intended for the following RFdiffusion commit:

```text
2d0c003df46b9db41d119321f15403dec3716cd9
```

Start from a clean RFdiffusion checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion.git
cd RFdiffusion
git checkout 2d0c003df46b9db41d119321f15403dec3716cd9
```

## Install OpenVDB support

ProteinSketch stores volumetric envelopes as OpenVDB SDF grids embedded in JSON files. Use the RFdiffusion conda environment and install OpenVDB support:

```bash
conda activate SE3nv
conda install conda-forge::openvdb
```

## Apply the ProteinSketch patch

Apply the patch from this repository:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/proteinsketch-rfdiffusion.patch \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supergermy/ProteinSketch/main/patches/px-rfdiffusion.patch

git apply --whitespace=nowarn --check /tmp/proteinsketch-rfdiffusion.patch
git apply --whitespace=nowarn /tmp/proteinsketch-rfdiffusion.patch
```

# Usage

ProteinSketch adds a JSON-based interface to RFdiffusion. The main entry point is still RFdiffusion's inference script, but designs can now be conditioned by ProteinSketch outputs through `inference.sketch_json`.

## ProteinSketch JSON input

ProteinSketch JSON files can contain three major sections:

- `target`: target PDB and optional hotspot residues for binder design
- `backbone`: sketched backbone PDB for partial diffusion
- `volume`: OpenVDB SDF envelope for volume-conditioned generation

A typical JSON file looks like this:

```json
{
    "format": "ProteinSketchOutput",
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "createdAt": "2099-01-01T23:59:59.115+09:00",
    "target": [
        {
            "format": "PDB",
            "encoding": "utf-8",
            "data": "HELIX    1  H1 GLY A   70  GLY A   72  1 ...",
            "hotspots": [
                "A392",
                "A394",
                "A421",
                "A423"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "backbone": [],
    "volume": [
        {
            "format": "OpenVDB",
            "encoding": "base64",
            "estimatedResidueCountRange": {
                "min": 329,
                "max": 342
            },
            "data": "niuLyrzVXCazo/B6gKDBo3UMo+..."
        }
    ]
}
```

Empty lists are treated as null values. The design mode is inferred from the populated sections:

```text
target=[]  backbone=[]  volume!=[]  -> monomer design with volume potential
target!=[] backbone=[]  volume!=[]  -> binder design with volume potential
target=[]  backbone!=[]             -> monomer partial diffusion
target!=[] backbone!=[]             -> binder partial diffusion
```

If a JSON file contains multiple volume entries, ProteinSketch uses `volume[0]` by default. Another entry can be selected with:

```text
inference.sketch_json_volume_index=<index>
```

## Running volume-conditioned monomer or binder design

To run RFdiffusion with a ProteinSketch JSON file:

```bash
python scripts/run_inference.py --config-name voxel \
  inference.sketch_json=/path/to/PROTEINSKETCH_VDB.json \
  inference.output_prefix=outputs/json_vdb/design \
  inference.num_designs=2
```

If the JSON contains only a volume, RFdiffusion runs monomer design with volume conditioning. If the JSON contains both a target and a volume, RFdiffusion runs binder design with volume conditioning.

ProteinSketch can infer `contigmap.contigs` from the estimated residue count stored in the JSON volume. You can override the inferred length manually (see [Examples](#examples)):

```bash
python scripts/run_inference.py --config-name voxel \
  inference.sketch_json=/path/to/PROTEINSKETCH_VDB.json \
  'contigmap.contigs=[150-170]' \
  inference.output_prefix=outputs/json_vdb/custom_length \
  inference.num_designs=2
```

## Two-step binder design

For target + volume binder design, the two-step workflow is recommended:

```bash
python scripts/two-step/run_inference_json_twostep.py \
  inference.sketch_json=/path/to/PROTEINSKETCH_VDB.json \
  inference.output_prefix=outputs/json_two_step/binder \
  inference.num_designs=2
```

The first stage samples binder-like monomer backbones under the sketched volume potential. The generated backbones are then transformed back into the original target coordinate frame and combined with the target PDB from the JSON input. The second stage runs partial diffusion on the target-frame complex to refine the binder while preserving the target placement.

## Partial diffusion for sketch refinement

ProteinSketch also supports sketch-derived backbone refinement with RFdiffusion partial diffusion. This is useful for regularizing manually sketched backbones while preserving the intended topology.

```bash
python scripts/run_inference.py \
  --config-name oneshot \
  inference.input_pdb=/path/to/input.pdb
```

The `oneshot` configuration is intended for fast partial-diffusion refinement of sketch-derived structures.

## Examples

Example scripts are provided in `examples/`. Set `RFDIFFUSION_DIR` to a patched RFdiffusion checkout and `SKETCH_JSON` to a ProteinSketch JSON file before running them.

```text
examples/sdf_cutoff_override.sh
examples/potential_weight_override_monomer.sh
examples/potential_weight_override_binder.sh
examples/potential_weight_override_twostep.sh
examples/contig_override.sh
```

These examples show how to:

- change the VDB SDF shell band with `inference.volume_sketch_cutoff`
- select a volume entry with `inference.sketch_json_volume_index`
- override monomer and binder volume-potential weights
- override interface weights for binder design
- manually override inferred `contigmap.contigs`
